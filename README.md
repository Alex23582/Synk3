Another version of Synk2 made with SvelteKit. A website to watch movies and videos synchronously over the internet. This version of Synk is pretty simple. The backend stores all state in memory and there are no user accounts. It's simpler and more usable.
The frontend communicates to the backend with expressjs and socket.io
